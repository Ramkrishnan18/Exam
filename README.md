This project demonstrates two practical approaches to face detection using Python—one with OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier and the other with MediaPipe’s real-time detection. The second part detects faces in a static image by converting it to grayscale and using a pre-trained Haar cascade to draw bounding boxes around detected faces. The first part uses a webcam to capture live video and applies MediaPipe’s face detection model to identify and highlight faces in real time, displaying the results instantly. Together, these methods showcase how face detection can be implemented both on static images and in live video streams, making it a powerful and accessible tool for real-world applications.
